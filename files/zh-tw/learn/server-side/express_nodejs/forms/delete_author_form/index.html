<p>此子文檔展示，如何定義頁面以刪除 <code>Author</code>對象。</p>

<p>正如<a href="/zh-TW/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/forms#form_design">表單設計</a>部分所討論的那樣，我們的策略是，只允許刪除“未被其他對象引用” 的對象（在這種情況下，這意味著如果作者<code>Author</code>被一本書<code>Book</code>引用，我們將不允許刪除作者）。在實現方面，這意味著，表單需要在刪除作者之前，先確認沒有關聯的書籍。如果存在關聯的書籍，則應顯示它們，並說明在刪除<code>Author</code>對象之前，必須刪除它們。</p>

<h2 id="Controller—get_route">Controller—get route</h2>

<p>Open <strong>/controllers/authorController.js</strong>. Find the exported <code>author_delete_get()</code> controller method and replace it with the following code.</p>

<pre class="brush: js line-numbers  language-js"><code class="language-js">// Display Author delete form on GET.
exports.author_delete_get = function(req, res, next) {

    async.parallel({
        author: function(callback) {
            Author.findById(req.params.id).exec(callback)
        },
        authors_books: function(callback) {
          Book.find({ 'author': req.params.id }).exec(callback)
        },
    }, function(err, results) {
        if (err) { return next(err); }
        if (results.author==null) { // No results.
            res.redirect('/catalog/authors');
        }
        // Successful, so render.
        res.render('author_delete', { title: 'Delete Author', author: results.author, author_books: results.authors_books } );
    });

};</code></pre>

<p>The controller gets the id of the <code>Author</code> instance to be deleted from the URL parameter (<code>req.params.id</code>). It uses the <code>async.parallel()</code> method to get the author record and all associated books in parallel. When both operations have completed it renders the <code><strong>author_delete</strong></code><strong>.pug</strong> view, passing variables for the <code>title</code>, <code>author</code>, and <code>author_books</code>.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If  <code>findById()</code><strong> </strong>returns no results the author is not in the database. In this case there is nothing to delete, so we immediately render the list of all authors. </p>

<pre class="brush: js line-numbers  language-js"><code class="language-js">}, function(err, results) {
    if (err) { return next(err); }
    if (results.author==null) { // No results.
        res.redirect('/catalog/authors')
    }</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="Controller—post_route">Controller—post route</h2>

<p>Find the exported <code>author_delete_post()</code> controller method, and replace it with the following code.</p>

<pre class="brush: js line-numbers  language-js"><code class="language-js">// Handle Author delete on POST.
exports.author_delete_post = function(req, res, next) {

    async.parallel({
        author: function(callback) {
          Author.findById(req.body.authorid).exec(callback)
        },
        authors_books: function(callback) {
          Book.find({ 'author': req.body.authorid }).exec(callback)
        },
    }, function(err, results) {
        if (err) { return next(err); }
        // Success
        if (results.authors_books.length &gt; 0) {
            // Author has books. Render in same way as for GET route.
            res.render('author_delete', { title: 'Delete Author', author: results.author, author_books: results.authors_books } );
            return;
        }
        else {
            // Author has no books. Delete object and redirect to the list of authors.
            Author.findByIdAndRemove(req.body.authorid, function deleteAuthor(err) {
                if (err) { return next(err); }
                // Success - go to author list
                res.redirect('/catalog/authors')
            })
        }
    });
};</code></pre>

<p>First we validate that an id has been provided (this is sent via the form body parameters, rather than using the version in the URL). Then we get the author and their associated books in the same way as for the <code>GET</code> route. If there are no books then we delete the author object and redirect to the list of all authors. If there are still books then we just re-render the form, passing in the author and list of books to be deleted.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We could check if the call to <code>findById()</code><strong> </strong>returns any result, and if not,  immediately render the list of all authors.  We've left the code as it is above for brevity (it will still return the list of authors if the id is not found, but this will happen after <code>findByIdAndRemove()</code>).</p>
</div>

<h2 id="View">View</h2>

<p>Create <strong>/views/author_delete.pug</strong> and copy in the text below.</p>

<pre class="line-numbers  language-html"><code class="language-html">extends layout

block content
  h1 #{title}: #{author.name}
  p= author.lifespan

  if author_books.length

    p #[strong Delete the following books before attempting to delete this author.]

    div(style='margin-left:20px;margin-top:20px')

      h4 Books

      dl
      each book in author_books
        dt
          a(href=book.url) #{book.title}
        dd #{book.summary}

  else
    p Do you really want to delete this Author?

    form(method='POST' action='')
      div.form-group
        input#authorid.form-control(type='hidden',name='authorid', required='true', value=author._id )

      button.btn.btn-primary(type='submit') Delete</code></pre>

<p>The view extends the layout template, overriding the block named <code>content</code>. At the top it displays the author details. It then includes a conditional statement based on the number of <code><strong>author_books</strong></code> (the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> clauses).</p>

<ul>
 <li>If there <em>are</em> books associated with the author then the page lists the books and states that these must be deleted before this <code>Author</code> may be deleted.</li>
 <li>If there <em>are no</em> books then the page displays a confirmation prompt. If the <strong>Delete</strong> button is clicked then the author id is sent to the server in a <code>POST</code> request and that author's record will be deleted.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Add_a_delete_control">Add a delete control</h2>

<p>Next we will add a <strong>Delete</strong> control to the<em> Author detail</em> view (the detail page is a good place from which to delete a record).</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In a full implementation the control would be made visible only to authorised users. However at this point we haven't got an authorisation system in place!</p>
</div>

<p>Open the <strong>author_detail.pug</strong> view and add the following lines at the bottom.</p>

<pre class="brush: html line-numbers  language-html"><code class="language-html">hr
p
  a(href=author.url+'/delete') Delete author</code></pre>

<p>The control should now appear as a link, as shown below on the <em>Author detail</em> page.</p>

<p><img src="locallibary_express_author_detail_delete.png"></p>

<h2 id="What_does_it_look_like">What does it look like?</h2>

<p>Run the application and open your browser to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>. Then select the <em>All authors </em>link, and then select a particular author. Finally select the <em>Delete author</em> link.</p>

<p>If the author has no books, you'll be presented with a page like this. After pressing delete, the server will delete the author and redirect to the author list.</p>

<p><img src="locallibary_express_author_delete_nobooks.png"></p>

<p>If the author does have books, then you'll be presented with a view like the following. You can then delete the books from their detail pages (once that code is implemented!).</p>

<p><img src="locallibary_express_author_delete_withbooks.png"></p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The other pages for deleting objects can be implemented in much the same way. We've left that as a challenge.</p>
</div>
